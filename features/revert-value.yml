name: revert
description: The `revert` keyword can be applied to any CSS property, resetting that property to the previous default, provided by either the user or browser stylesheets. For example, setting `display:revert` on a `<div>` will likely result in `display:block`, the browser default style. This is often confused with `initial` which provides the specified initial value of a property, regardless of the element.
